# About this book

We develop a theory for how types of [Spiking Neural Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiking_neural_network) can be developed to display general intelligence.
Spikes are simply digitized events---demarcations of moments in time, but they are also how the neurons in brains communicate to interpret the world and induce feelings and behaviors.
We consider how arbitrary signals can be digitized in time and how systems can learn to recognize and participate in temporal patterns that elicit intelligent behaviors.
To best illustrate and comprehend these dynamics, this book has been written in [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org), which allows for interactivity.
The examples and underlying code are available for further development and exploration.
